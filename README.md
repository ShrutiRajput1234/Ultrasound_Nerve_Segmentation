# Ultrasound Nerve Segmentation
The project is based on CNN U-Net. We developed a python application which segmented images of brachial plexus tissues and shows the nerve cluster accurately. 
This app shows accuracy of 98%

# Vison
1. The crux of our project is to detect the nerve clusters in the human body and segment them accordingly. This segmentation is very useful for accurate medication
of a patient after a surgery or before a surgery.
2. To identify nerve structures an ultrasound image of the region containing nerves is taken but identification is a non-trivial task even for the experts in the field as
the images generated by ultrasound are affected by echo perturbations and speckle noise. This enhances the need for correctly identifying the right nerve region to
provide anesthesia.
3. To build an end-to-end system where a person would just be feeding the ultrasound image of the region and a deep learning model will segment the nerve present in
the image.

# Getting Started
To run this repo, be sure to install the following environment and library:
1. Python 2.7
2. Tensorflow=1.2.0
3. Keras=2.1.1
4. Pandas=0.20.3
5. Numpy=1.13.3
6. h5py=2.7.0
7. sklearn=0.19.1

# Opearating Environment
* We will be using the dataset for our project from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
* For software processing, we will use [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
* To define the pipeline following which image and label would be input to the model for training.
For this, we will use the [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) data pipeline.
* For the classifier, we are using a transfer learning approach and using an Inception-ResnetV2 architecture trained on the imagenet dataset.

_Dataset is uploaded on this repo itself_
